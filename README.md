# DerivativeEstimationToolbox

Derivative estimation for Matlab Simulink, based on methods of differential algebra.
The repository consists of two separate projects:
* derive.c: integrals are solved using Gauss's area formula
* DETfunc.c: solving of discrete integrals, exact solution

Code has to be compiled to be executed with Matlab Simulink.
